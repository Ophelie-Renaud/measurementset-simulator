# Generating distributed MeasurementSet

#### Interferometric context

Radio interferometric imaging uses interferometers to measure visibilities, which are samples of the sky obtained from pairs of antennas. To transform these visibilities into an image of the sky, imaging algorithms generally use two main steps: a major loop (‚àÜ) and a minor loop (Œ®).

- The major loop (‚àÜ) manages the transformation of the visibilities into a *dirty* image of the sky via gridding and screening operations. `Gridding` consists of projecting the visibilities onto a regular grid in the *uv* plane in order to facilitate the application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to generate a dirty image. `Degridding` performs the opposite operation, comparing the visibilities calculated from an image model and adjusting them accordingly. 
- The minor loop (Œ®) is used to clean the dirty image of artefacts introduced by the instrumentation. Of the algorithms available, Clean by Hogbom [2] is the most commonly used. This algorithm first identifies the dominant sources in the dirty image, then models these sources while removing the artefacts associated with the instrumental response (PSF). Finally, the image is updated iteratively until it converges on a clean version.

By combining these two loops, it is possible to obtain an accurate image of the sky from the raw data provided by the interferometer.

Most interferometric imagers (ddfacet, sep, generic imaging pipeline etc) take a [MeasurementSet](https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html) *.ms file as input and generate an image as output. The most commonly used format is [Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2010/16/aa15362-10/aa15362-10.html) *.fits.

#### Project motivation

As we are keen to benchmark the performance of our pipelines over a wide range of case studies, and as we don't have access to telescopes, we are going to generate our own `MeasurementSet` on which we will have control over the configuration of the instruments and the image of the true sky. 



![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ophelie-Renaud/vis-generator/refs/heads/main/pic/proj.png)

This project aim to create `visibilities.ms` from `output.fits` image which correspond to the reverse steps of standard radio-astronomy imaging pipeline. 

This project contains two implementation of the MS simulator:

#### Python-based simulator (SKAO library)

This simulator is based on **RASCIL** degridder and **SKAO SDP** libraries. It allow to generate distributed measurementSet from a given true sky image considering interferometer configuration such as the MEERKAT telescope among others. 

üìå All the process are contained in the notebook `distributed_ms_from_fits_rascil` except the `ska_sdp_datamodels`  and  `ska-sdp-func-python` install them before benefiting from this project.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-datamodels.git
cd ska_sdp_datamodels
pip install --extra-index-url https://artefact.skao.int/repository/pypi-internal/simple ska-telmodel
pip install .
cd ..

git clone https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-func-python.git
cd ska-sdp-func-python
pip install .
cd..

pip install python-casacore

pip install notebook

jupyter notebook
```
#### Dataflow-based simulator

This simulator is based on a standard dataflow degridder used in the **Generic Imaging Pipeline (GIP)** and the **SDP evolutionary pipeline (SEP)**. It allow to generate visibilities from a custom true sky image. 

Parameterized implementations of the GIP has been proposed in this repository: ‚û°Ô∏è **[simsdp-generic-imaging-pipeline](https://github.com/Ophelie-Renaud/simsdp-generic-imaging-pipeline)** *(submitted to GRETSI 2025)* . This result in a parametric executable: `./Pipeline <NUM_VIS> <GRID_SIZE> <NUM_MINOR_CYCLE>`. This assumes that the true sky image is also parametric, which is the purpose of this simulator.  These two parametric components will allow to facilitate algorithm exploration to identify the parameters and configuration that block the scaling on HPC systems.  

üìå All the process are contained in the notebook `ms_from_fits_dataflow` executing the parametric executable.

```bash
cd dataflow_simulator/code/
cmake .
make
cd ..
jupyter notebook
```

## Planning
This hackathon comprises 2 phases:
- Phase 1: getting to grips with the SKA SDP libraries, generation of distributed MS, first test as ddfacet input, validation via casacore.
- Phase 2: generation of configurable MS, test as GIP input.
